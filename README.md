# Facility-Hunt
These are the code files I had written for the game Facility Hunt, which I created for Learn You A Game Jam: Pixel Edition, along with a PDF of the documentation I wrote as I create the game and its engine.

The .wav sound files are missing here as the purpose of this repo is to showcase the code itself.

The game can be found here: https://syntaxgarden.itch.io/facility-hunt
